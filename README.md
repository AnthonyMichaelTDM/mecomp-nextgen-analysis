# MECOMP Nextgen Analysis

This repository contains the code and documentation for the embeddings model created as part of our ELEC 576 final project.
The model is designed to generate meaningful vector embeddings for music, and will be integrated into [MECOMP](https://github.com/AnthonyMichaelTDM/mecomp).
